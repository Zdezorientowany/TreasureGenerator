# DarkAndDarkerTraesureGenerator

This is a Python script that generates random treasures based on quality, material, and items from a JSON file. It includes two options for generating treasures: a quick generate with one click and an advanced generator with prompts to change variables. The treasures generated are represented by the Treasure class, which includes attributes such as name, value, size, material, and quality. This script can be used for game development or any other project that requires random treasure generation.
